  This view is only needed to prevent tests from failing. The #create action

  Error when running "rspec spec/controllers/statements_controller_spec.rb "

    1) StatementsController POST #create returns http success
       Failure/Error: post :create, params: {user_id: user, statement: statement_attributes }

       ActionController::UnknownFormat:
         StatementsController#create is missing a template for this request format and variant.

         request.formats: ["text/html"]

   My hypothesis is that you need to let the test know to not look for a view
   but instead send look for the file "create.js.erb" instead. This is because
   "create" gets triggered from the from in the "new" view using AJAX. So,
   further research is needed to make the test more accurate and delete this
   otherwise useless view.
